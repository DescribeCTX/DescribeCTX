## Compared to Related Work
Zhang et al.[1] propose DescribeMe, that extracts textual features from Android APKs, and uses templates to generate descriptions for the sequence of statements that lead to the invocation of a permission-protected API call. The main difference between their work and DescribeCTX is that they applied a ***template-based*** language model, which directly combined the pre-defined template with the text features. However, DescribeCTX extract more feature (i.e. permission descriptions) from apps' privacy policies to provide vocabularies to the model. Besides, DescribeCTX is a ***learning-based*** model which applies seq-to-seq model with two attention mechanisms to generate descriptions for the sensitive behaviors. 

Due to the limitation of the fixed set of templates, the generated descriptions have fixed formats and have very limited capabilities to describe various types of app behaviors. 
Also, it lacks the vocabularies for describing sensitive behaviors, and focuses on explaining the statements (such as sending data to network) rather than their purposes.
DescribeCTX addresses the limitations of DescribeMe by learning a seq2seq model that leverages GUI, code, and privacy policies to generate descriptions for sensitive behaviors. The generated descriptions are not limited to a fixed set of formats, and the vocabularies from the text in the GUIs and privacy policies help explain the purposes of the sensitive behaviors.

Since Zhang do not open source any of their work, we can only find some examples and templates from their paper, as shown below. As we found only SMS templates from their paper, we compare the generated descriptions for only SMS permission. The results show that the BLEU score of DescribeMe (14.46) is 41.10% lower than DescribeCTX (24.55). Compared to our results, it is clear that their results is too generic and not app-specific at all. It is obvious that template-based approach is not able to handle unseen apps, and it completely depends on the quality of templates, not to mention their approach is not able to scale to a large number of apps.
